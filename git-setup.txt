Subject: SDE Assignment - Nov 2025

Dear Hiring Team,

Please find my submission for the SDE Assignment - Nov 2025.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/time-range-merger-sde-assignment

The repository contains a NodeJS module that merges discontinuous time ranges within a given threshold, as per the assignment requirements.

Key Features:
- Clean, readable, and modular code
- Handles unsorted and overlapping ranges
- Configurable threshold for merging
- Comprehensive test suite
- Complete documentation

The main module file is mergeTimeRanges.js which exports the required function.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
